# Invoice Data Extraction of Bhat Bhateni Supermarket

This project focuses on extracting relevant data from invoices generated by Bhat Bhateni Supermarket using the Donut model. Donut (Document Understanding Transformer) is a transformer-based architecture designed to handle document image understanding tasks. This project involves fine-tuning Donut on the specific invoices from Bhat Bhateni for optimal performance.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automatically extract and parse information from scanned or digital invoices provided by Bhat Bhateni Supermarket. The extracted data includes key information such as:

- Address
- VAT No
- Bill No
- Invoice Date
- Payment Date
- Gross Amount
- Net Amount
- Total Quantity
- Item details (item names, prices, quantities, etc.)

We fine-tune the Donut model using the provided invoices from Bhat Bhateni Supermarket to ensure that the model accurately identifies and extracts these fields.

## Donut Model

Donut is an open-source transformer-based model designed for document image understanding tasks. It can perform tasks such as optical character recognition (OCR), document layout understanding, and structured data extraction.

For more information, you can refer to the official GitHub repository for Donut: [Donut by Clova AI](https://github.com/clovaai/donut)

## Fine-tuning the Model

The fine-tuning process was done following the approach outlined in the fine-tuning notebook provided by [Niels Rogge](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/Donut/CORD/Fine_tune_Donut_on_a_custom_dataset_(CORD)_with_PyTorch_Lightning.ipynb).
